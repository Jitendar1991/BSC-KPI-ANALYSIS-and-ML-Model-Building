# BSC-KPI-ANALYSIS-and-ML-Model-Building
In This Project we analyze last five days  BSC KPI of a circle and also predict Traffic volume for future parameters.

-We extract data from mysql database server and then we did some data preprocessing.
-In our data set we have BSCname and their respective KPI features of last five days.
